SECTION 1: BOOKS - AUTHORED
========================================

Cortés, C. E. (2000). *The children are watching: How the media teach about diversity*. Teachers College Press. ISBN 9780807739372
    https://www.amazon.com/Children-Are-Watching-Diversity-Multicultural/dp/0807739375

This groundbreaking book analyzes how both entertainment and news media frame diversity-related themes and transmit values concerning race, ethnicity, gender, religion, and sexual orientation. Cortés examines how media contribute to stereotypes and influence public thinking about diversity issues, representing the culmination of his research specialty in media treatment of diversity. The work is widely cited as an influential contribution to both education and media studies literature and established Cortés as a leading voice in understanding media's role in diversity education.

Cortés, C. E. (2002). *The making—and remaking—of a multiculturalist*. Teachers College Press. ISBN 9780807742518
    https://www.amazon.com/Making-Remaking-Multiculturalist-Multicultural-Education/dp/0807742511
    https://archive.org/details/makingremakingof0000cort

In this autobiographical educational memoir, Cortés traces his personal and professional journey in becoming and continuously evolving as a multiculturalist. The book explores the development of multicultural education as a field while simultaneously narrating Cortés's own intellectual transformation and contributions to diversity scholarship. In many ways, Cortés's personal and professional story mirrors the story of the multicultural movement itself. The work serves as both a theoretical contribution and a historical document chronicling the emergence of multicultural education from the 1960s through the early 2000s.

Cortés, C. E. (2012). *Rose Hill: An intermarriage before its time*. Heyday. ISBN 9781597141888
    https://www.heydaybooks.com/catalog/rose-hill-an-intermarriage-before-its-time/
    https://www.amazon.com/Rose-Hill-Intermarriage-Before-Time/dp/1597141887

This memoir recounts Cortés's childhood as the son of a Mexican Catholic immigrant father with aristocratic roots and an American-born Jewish mother of Eastern European descent in racially segregated, religiously divided Kansas City, Missouri. The marriage occurred in 1933, when such interracial, interfaith unions were rare, and the book explores the internal family conflicts and external social pressures they faced. Adapted from his nationally successful one-person play "A Conversation with Alana," the memoir addresses navigating Kansas City's rigid racial, ethnic, and religious fault lines during the 1940s and 1950s. The work was copublished with the Inlandia Institute and received positive reviews for its exploration of identity, cultural conflict, and family dynamics.

Cortés, C. E. (2016). *Fourth quarter: Reflections of a cranky old man*. Bad Knee Press. ISBN [Not available]
    https://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Quarter-Reflections-Cranky-Old/dp/1945378042

This poetry collection, Cortés's first book of verse, reflects on the unpredictability and ironic twists of past, present, and future from the perspective of an iconoclastic octogenarian. The poems explore life in the "fourth quarter" with wit, wisdom, and unflinching honesty about aging, mortality, and cultural change. The collection received Honorable Mention for Best Book of Poetry in the 2017 International Latino Book Awards, demonstrating Cortés's versatility as a writer beyond academic scholarship. The work showcases his ability to address diversity, identity, and social commentary through creative literary forms.

Cortés, C. E. (2025). *Scouts' honor*. Inlandia Institute. ISBN [Not available]
    https://www.pressenterprise.com/2025/10/26/a-debut-novel-at-91-carlos-cortes-of-riverside-crafts-whodunit/
    https://www.pressenterprise.com/2025/09/16/90-something-first-time-novelist-shares-his-book-writing-experience/

Published when Cortés was 91, this debut novel is a mystery/whodunit set at Boy Scout Camp Matulia in southwestern Missouri, centered on the death of Boy Scout Harry Vincent. While inspired by Cortés's own experiences at summer camp at age 14, he added the fictional murder element to create the mystery plot. The novel represents Cortés's first venture into long-form fiction after a career primarily focused on academic scholarship and autobiography. Launch events were held on August 31, 2025, at the Civil Rights Institute of Inland Southern California in Riverside, and on September 20, 2025, at the Maloof Foundation in Rancho Cucamonga.

Cortés, C. E., Ginsburg, A. I., Green, A. W. F., & Joseph, J. A. (1976). *Three perspectives on ethnicity: Blacks, Chicanos, and Native Americans*. G.P. Putnam's Sons. ISBN 9780399503696
    https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/three-perspectives-ethnicity-blacks-chicanos/
    Available: WorldCat, used book dealers

This 429-page academic work examines ethnicity from the perspectives of three major American ethnic groups: African Americans, Chicanos/Mexican Americans, and Native Americans. The comparative approach allowed for analysis of commonalities and differences in ethnic experiences, discrimination, cultural preservation, and resistance movements. Published during a formative period in ethnic studies scholarship, the book contributed to the theoretical frameworks for understanding multiple ethnic experiences rather than treating each group in isolation. The work reflects the collaborative, interdisciplinary approach characteristic of early ethnic studies scholarship.

Cortés, C. E. (1974). *Gaúcho politics in Brazil: The politics of Rio Grande do Sul, 1930-1964*. University of New Mexico Press. ISBN 9780826303035
    https://www.amazon.com/Gaucho-Politics-Brazil-Grande-1930-1964/dp/082630303X
    Available: WorldCat, Amazon (used copies)

Based on Cortés's doctoral dissertation research, this scholarly monograph examines regional politics in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, during a crucial period of Brazilian political development. The book analyzes how the distinctive gaucho culture and regional identity of Rio Grande do Sul influenced political movements, party formations, and relationships with the national Brazilian government. The work received the prestigious Hubert Herring Memorial Award from the Pacific Coast Council on Latin American Studies, establishing Cortés's credentials as a Latin American historian before he shifted his primary focus to Chicano studies and multicultural education. The book remains a significant contribution to Brazilian political history and regional studies.

SECTION 2: BOOKS - EDITED
========================================

Cortés, C. E. (Ed.). (2013). *Multicultural America: A multimedia encyclopedia* (Vols. 1-4). SAGE Publications. Print ISBN 9781452216836, Online ISBN 9781452276274. https://doi.org/10.4135/9781452276274
    https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/multicultural-america/book237498
    https://sk.sagepub.com/reference/multicultural-america
    https://archive.org/details/multiculturalame0000unse_l7j7

This comprehensive four-volume, 2,528-page encyclopedia contains more than 900 signed entries examining historical and contemporary issues in multicultural America. The work was among the first reference publications to extensively use newly released 2010 U.S. Census data to analyze multiculturalism's present and future trajectory in the United States. As general editor, Cortés coordinated contributions from numerous scholars across disciplines, creating a major reference work in multicultural studies. While comprehensive for its time, Cortés himself notes in his 2025 "Renewing Multicultural Education" keynote that in just over a decade, the United States the encyclopedia portrayed has changed dramatically, demonstrating the rapid pace of demographic and cultural transformation.

Cortés, C. E. (Ed.). (1980). *Hispanics in the United States* (30 volumes). Arno Press. ISBN [Individual volume ISBNs vary]
    Available: WorldCat, major research libraries, used book dealers

This monumental 30-volume series, edited by Cortés for Arno Press, represents a comprehensive reprint collection of significant historical and contemporary scholarship on Hispanic experiences in the United States. Arno Press specialized in reprinting rare and long out-of-print materials, making important but inaccessible scholarship available to researchers and libraries. Individual volumes include works such as "Cuban Refugee Programs" and cover diverse topics related to Hispanic history, immigration, culture, education, and social experiences. The series was part of Cortés's larger editorial work with Arno Press, which also included "The Mexican American" (21-volume series, 1974) and "The Chicano Heritage" (55-volume series, 1976), totaling over 106 volumes of reprinted Hispanic and Chicano scholarship.


========================================
SECTION 3: BOOK CHAPTERS
========================================

Cortés, C. E. (1973). Teaching the Chicano experience. In J. A. Banks (Ed.), *Teaching ethnic studies: Concepts and strategies* (pp. 181-199). National Council for the Social Studies.
    ERIC Document ED079204: https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED079204
    Available: Research libraries, ERIC database

This chapter in James Banks's influential 1973 volume represents one of Cortés's earliest and most significant contributions to the emerging field of multicultural education. Written during the formative years of both Chicano Studies and ethnic studies more broadly, the chapter provided practical frameworks for teaching about the Chicano experience in K-12 classrooms. When Banks's book became widely adopted for teacher training programs, Cortés found himself on the national speakers' circuit for K-12 multicultural education, launching his career as a diversity educator and consultant. The chapter helped establish methodological approaches for ethnic studies pedagogy that influenced subsequent curriculum development nationwide.

Cortés, C. E. (1986). The education of language minority students: A contextual interaction model. In California State Department of Education, Bilingual Education Office, *Beyond language: Social and cultural factors in schooling language minority students* (pp. 3-33). California State Department of Education. ISBN 9780897550246
    ERIC Document ED304241: https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED304241
    https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Language-Cultural-Schooling-Minority/dp/0897550242

As the introductory chapter of this influential anthology, Cortés presents a theoretical framework for understanding how sociocultural factors influence language minority education in U.S. public schools. The "contextual interaction model" examines variables beyond linguistics that impede or support successful academic performance by immigrant minority students. The chapter synthesizes research on sociocultural barriers, institutional practices, and community factors affecting language minority achievement. Published by the California State Department of Education and funded by the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs, the work influenced state-level policy discussions on bilingual and multicultural education during the 1980s.

Cortés, C. E. (2015). Intercultural humor. In J. M. Bennett (Ed.), *The SAGE encyclopedia of intercultural competence* (pp. 452-456). SAGE Publications.
    Available: SAGE Reference online, research libraries

In this encyclopedia entry, Cortés explores the complex role of humor in intercultural communication, examining how humor functions as both a bridge and barrier across cultural boundaries. The essay analyzes different types of intercultural humor, including self-deprecating humor, cross-cultural misunderstandings as humor sources, and the use of humor in diversity training and education. Cortés draws on his extensive experience as a diversity trainer and workshop facilitator to provide practical insights alongside theoretical frameworks. The entry contributes to understanding humor as a dimension of intercultural competence, an area often overlooked in diversity scholarship.


========================================
SECTION 4: JOURNAL ARTICLES
========================================

Cortés, C. E. (2019). Beyond free speech: Fostering civic engagement at the intersection of diversity and expression. *American Diversity Report* [Electronic magazine]. Also published in *Society for Intercultural Education, Training and Research* e-zine.
    Available: C:\Users\ginja\Downloads\Cortes_Research.article.BeyondFreespeech.pdf

This 20-page research article emerged from Cortés's fellowship with the University of California National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement. The article examines the complex intersection of diversity and speech on U.S. college campuses, exploring how free speech principles and diversity values can coexist and strengthen each other rather than existing in tension. Cortés analyzes fifty years of evolving relationships between diversity movements and free speech advocacy, drawing on his extensive experience in both multicultural education and academic freedom discussions. The article was adapted for publication in two electronic magazines, demonstrating the crossover appeal of his research beyond traditional academic outlets.

Cortés, C. E. (2025). Renewing multicultural education: An ancient mariner's manifesto. *Multicultural Perspectives, 27*(2), 66-75. https://doi.org/10.1080/15210960.2025.2558492
    Published online October 16, 2025
    https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/hmcp20
    Available: C:\Users\ginja\Downloads\Renewing_Multicultural_Education_Ancient_Mariners_Manifesto.pdf

Adaptation of Cortés's keynote address delivered at the 2024 National Association for Multicultural Education conference in Anaheim, California, this article presents a critical manifesto for renewing the multicultural education movement. Cortés identifies three "bad habits" that have crept into multicultural education practice: (1) "admiring the problem" rather than pivoting to future-oriented solutions, (2) lack of inclusivity and transparency in implementation, and (3) "linguistic madness" that alienates natural allies through excessive focus on microaggressions and language policing. Drawing on his "Cortés Triad" framework (look unflinchingly at the past, apply it to the present, then pivot to the future), he argues for action-oriented diversity work that builds bridges rather than barriers. The article received 199 views within its first two months of publication and represents Cortés's latest theoretical contribution to diversity education at age 90.


========================================
SECTION 5: BLOG/ONLINE ARTICLES
========================================

NOTE: Dr. Cortés writes monthly columns for the American Diversity Report (ADR). The following represents identified articles from his extensive "Diversity and Speech" and "Renewing Diversity" series, as well as standalone pieces. Many additional articles exist; this list includes those with verified titles and URLs as of December 2025.

========================================
5A: "Diversity and Speech" Series
========================================

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Speech vs. diversity, diversity vs. speech. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/speech-vs-diversity-diversity-vs-speech-by-carlos-e-cortes/

This foundational article introduces Cortés's ongoing exploration of the complex, often contentious relationship between diversity advocacy and free speech principles. The piece establishes the framework for his monthly column series examining this intersection over fifty years. Cortés argues that the perceived conflict between diversity and speech is largely invented rather than inherent, and that both values can and should reinforce each other. This article relates to his book-in-progress on the same topic and his 2019 fellowship research.

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Diversity vs. free speech part 1: An invented conflict. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/diversity-vs-free-speech-part-1-an-invented-conflict-by-carlos-e-cortes/

The first numbered installment in the series elaborates the thesis that diversity and free speech are falsely positioned as opposing values. Cortés examines how diversity advocates have historically benefited from robust free speech protections to advance social justice causes. He critiques both sides for creating unnecessary polarization and calls for recognizing the complementary nature of these principles. The article draws on historical civil rights movements that relied on free speech protections to challenge discriminatory systems.

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Diversity and speech part 10: Harmful speech 2070. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/diversity-and-speech-part-10-harmful-speech-2070-by-carlos-e-cortes/

Using a speculative future-looking framework set in 2070, this article examines the concept of "harmful speech" and its implications for both diversity and free expression. Cortés explores definitional challenges around what constitutes harm, who determines harm, and how societies might balance protection from harmful speech with preservation of robust dialogue. The 2070 framing allows him to step outside current political debates and consider longer-term trajectories. This approach reflects his "pivot to the future" philosophy rather than remaining mired in present-day conflicts.

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Diversity and speech part 11: Dehumanizing speech 2070. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/diversity-and-speech-part-11-dehumanizing-speech-2070-by-carlos-e-cortes/

Continuing the 2070 speculative framework, this installment focuses specifically on dehumanizing speech—language that reduces people to subhuman status and historically has presaged violence and genocide. Cortés grapples with whether and how dehumanizing speech should be regulated, examining international human rights frameworks, historical examples from the Holocaust to Rwanda, and contemporary debates about hate speech laws. He considers the tension between protecting vulnerable populations from dehumanization and maintaining democratic discourse. The article demonstrates Cortés's willingness to engage with difficult questions rather than offering simplistic solutions.

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Diversity & speech part 15: English language learners. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/diversity-speech-part-15-english-language-learners-by-carlos-cortes/

This article addresses the intersection of language rights, educational equity, and free expression in the context of English language learners in U.S. schools. Cortés examines debates over bilingual education, English-only policies, and linguistic diversity as a dimension of multiculturalism. Drawing on his earlier work on language minority education and his chapter in "Beyond Language," he analyzes how language policy reflects broader tensions between assimilation and cultural pluralism. The piece considers both student speech rights and pedagogical questions about language instruction methods.

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Diversity & speech part 16: Creating an anti-racism vision statement. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/diversity-speech-part-16-creating-an-anti-racism-vision-statement-by-carlos-e-cortes/

Based on his experience coordinating the development of the City of Riverside's Anti-Racism Vision Statement (adopted 6-1 by the City Council in October 2020), this article provides practical guidance for creating community-based anti-racism statements. Cortés emphasizes the importance of inclusive process, clear language accessible to general audiences (not just academics), and transparency with community stakeholders. He describes the collaborative method used in Riverside, involving drafts circulated to about 100 people with rapid turnaround for feedback. The article demonstrates his commitment to bridging academic theory and practical community action, and it relates to his critique of jargon-heavy diversity work that alienates potential allies.

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Diversity and speech part 18: Hate speech. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/diversity-and-speech-part-18-hate-speech-by-carlos-e-cortes/

This installment tackles one of the most contentious areas in the diversity-speech intersection: hate speech and whether it should face legal restrictions or social sanctions. Cortés examines differing international approaches, comparing European hate speech laws with U.S. First Amendment protections. He analyzes Supreme Court jurisprudence, campus speech codes, and the effectiveness of various approaches to combating hatred while preserving open discourse. The article reflects Cortés's nuanced position that values both protecting vulnerable communities and maintaining robust free expression.

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Diversity and speech #25: Growing up bi-religious. *American Diversity Report*.
    Available: American Diversity Report website (specific URL not indexed)

Drawing on his personal experience as the child of a Mexican Catholic father and Jewish mother, this article explores religious diversity and interfaith dialogue from an autobiographical perspective. Cortés reflects on navigating two religious traditions simultaneously in 1940s Kansas City, where religious divisions were sharp and intermarriage rare. The piece connects personal narrative to broader themes of religious diversity, identity formation, and the role of religion in multicultural America. It complements his memoir "Rose Hill" and his play "A Conversation with Alana" in exploring his bi-religious upbringing.

Cortés, C. E., & Howard, M. G. (n.d.). Diversity and speech no. 27: Training future psychologists using the lens of history. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/diversity-and-speech-no-27-training-future-psychologists-using-the-lens-of-history-by-carlos-e-cortes-marjorie-graham-howard/

Co-authored with Marjorie Graham-Howard, this article applies historical perspectives to diversity training in psychology education. The piece argues that understanding historical context—including the history of psychology's role in perpetuating racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination—is essential for training culturally competent psychologists. The authors advocate for integrating historical analysis into diversity curricula rather than treating diversity as ahistorical. This collaborative article demonstrates Cortés's continued engagement with health professions education through his work at UC Riverside School of Medicine.

Cortés, C. E., & Cortés, G. (n.d.). Diversity and speech #33: Bi-religious. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/diversity-and-speech-33-bi-religious-by-carlos-cortes-gary-cortes/

Co-authored with Gary Cortés (likely a family member), this article expands on the bi-religious theme introduced in #25, exploring the experiences and perspectives of individuals raised in multiple religious traditions. The piece examines how bi-religious identity intersects with other aspects of diversity and considers the role of interfaith families in promoting religious pluralism. It may include intergenerational dialogue about changes in acceptance of interfaith marriages from the 1930s (when Cortés's parents married) to the present. The collaborative authorship suggests personal as well as scholarly dimensions to the exploration.

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Diversity and speech part 44: Generations of gender talk. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/diversity-and-speech-part-44-generations-of-gender-talk-by-carlos-cortes/

This article examines how language and discourse around gender have evolved across generations, from mid-20th-century frameworks to contemporary understandings of gender identity, expression, and fluidity. Cortés analyzes generational differences in terminology, concepts, and underlying assumptions about gender. The piece likely addresses the 2024 Trump campaign ad "Kamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you," which Cortés discusses in his 2025 "Renewing Multicultural Education" keynote. He explores how to bridge generational divides in gender discourse rather than dismissing either traditional or contemporary perspectives.

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Diversity and speech no. 46: The art of turning 90. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/diversity-and-speech-no-46-the-art-of-turning-90-by-carlos-cortes/

Written around or after Cortés's 90th birthday, this reflective piece considers aging, longevity, and continued engagement with diversity work from the perspective of nonagenarian scholarship. The article likely addresses ageism as a diversity issue, the value of elder wisdom in social justice movements, and staying relevant as society changes rapidly. Cortés's own continued productivity—including publishing his first novel at 91—provides a personal case study in active aging. The piece may critique both dismissal of elder perspectives and the romanticization of age without acknowledging real limitations.

========================================
5B: "Renewing Diversity" Series
========================================

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Renewing diversity # 1: High school ethnic studies. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/renewing-diversity-1-high-school-ethnic-studies-by-carlos-cortes/

This article discusses California's Assembly Bill 101 (the Medina Bill), which made California the first state to require all high school students to complete a one-semester course in Ethnic Studies. Cortés analyzes the rocky legislative journey of the bill, controversies over the Model Curriculum, and his own role in drafting principles that helped break the impasse. The piece examines both the promise and challenges of mandating ethnic studies, including questions of which ethnic groups to include, pedagogical approaches, and community involvement. It reflects Cortés's ongoing commitment to ethnic studies since introducing UCR's first Chicano History class in January 1970.

Cortés, C. E., & Osei, A. (n.d.). Renewing diversity #2: Teaching health equity. *American Diversity Report*.
    Available: American Diversity Report website (specific URL not indexed)

Co-authored with Dr. Adwoa Osei (Cortés's partner in co-directing the UC Riverside School of Medicine's Health Equity, Social Justice, and Anti-Racism curriculum), this article addresses diversity and equity in medical education. The piece likely describes the required curricular thread they developed, which represents an application of multicultural education principles to health professions training. The collaboration demonstrates how diversity education has expanded beyond K-12 and higher education humanities into professional schools. The article may address health disparities, cultural competence in healthcare, and the importance of anti-racism training for future physicians.

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Renewing diversity #3: We failed George Floyd. *American Diversity Report*.
    Available: American Diversity Report website (specific URL not indexed)

Written in response to the 2020 Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, this article critiques the diversity training industry's failure to prevent such tragedies and its inadequate response afterward. As excerpted in the 2025 "Renewing Multicultural Education" keynote, Cortés recounts an "ah-hah moment" when a friend, fresh from a microaggressions workshop, scolded him for asking "Where are you from?"—treating Derald Wing Sue's microaggression list as a definitive do-and-don't guide rather than a discussion starting point. He argues that many diversity trainers failed George Floyd by encouraging people to "mope about themselves" and focus on avoiding offense rather than analyzing structures and developing constructive strategies for substantive equity and social justice.

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). Renewing diversity no. 4: A sliver of bone. *American Diversity Report*.
    Available: American Diversity Report website (specific URL not indexed)

While specific content is not available without accessing the article directly, the title "A Sliver of Bone" suggests a personal narrative or metaphor related to diversity, identity, or cultural inheritance. Given Cortés's writing style, this may explore a moment of personal revelation, a family story, or an incident that illuminates broader diversity themes. The "sliver" metaphor could relate to partial identities, fragments of cultural memory, or small but significant markers of difference. This article is part of Cortés's "Renewing Diversity" series addressing contemporary challenges in diversity work.

Cortés, C. E. (2025). Renewing diversity part 9: Rediscovering my professional journey. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/renewing-diversity-part-9-rediscovering-my-professional-journey-by-carlos-cortes/

In this autobiographical reflection published in 2025, Cortés traces his professional evolution from Latin American historian to Chicano Studies pioneer to national multicultural education leader. The article likely discusses key turning points including joining UC Riverside in 1968, becoming chair of Chicano Studies in 1972, writing for James Banks's 1973 ethnic studies volume, and taking early retirement in 1994 to focus on diversity consulting. The piece demonstrates Cortés's practice of "looking unflinchingly at the past" while considering how his experiences inform his current work at age 90-plus. It provides context for understanding the development of his theoretical frameworks and practical approaches to diversity education.

5C: Standalone Blog Articles
========================================

Cortés, C. E. (n.d.). From conditional to equitable inclusion: Inclusivity for a stronger nation. *American Diversity Report*.
    https://americandiversityreport.com/from-conditional-to-equitable-inclusion-by-carlos-cortes/

This standalone article distinguishes between "conditional inclusion"—allowing participation only under terms set by dominant groups—and "equitable inclusion"—restructuring systems to accommodate diverse participants on fair terms. Cortés analyzes how institutions often practice performative inclusion without substantive equity, creating appearance of diversity without redistributing power or resources. The piece connects to his work on the City of Riverside's "Building a More Inclusive Riverside Community" statement (2001) and his emphasis on transparency and genuine community engagement. The article provides theoretical framework for assessing whether diversity initiatives produce meaningful change or merely cosmetic adjustments.

This one-hour, one-person autobiographical play presents Cortés's story of growing up as a young man of mixed ancestry in racially segregated, religiously divided, class-conscious early post-World War II Kansas City, Missouri. The son of a Mexican Catholic immigrant father and an American-born Jewish mother, Cortés uses the conceit of a conversation with an empty chair representing his 46-year-old daughter Alana "in a conversation that never occurred." The play has been performed nearly 160 times throughout the United States at universities, colleges, and educational institutions, including notable performances at UC Santa Cruz Colleges Nine & Ten (2015-16). The work was adapted into his 2012 memoir "Rose Hill: An Intermarriage Before Its Time" and represents Cortés's most successful venture into theatrical performance and creative writing beyond academic scholarship.

SECTION 10: CURRICULUM DOCUMENTS & POLICY PAPERS
========================================

Cortés, C. E. (2021). *Suggested basic curriculum principles for ethnic studies* [Policy document]. California State Board of Education. (12 pages)
    Reference: California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (2021), pp. 16-20
    Available: California Department of Education website; referenced in California AB 101 legislative materials

At the request of the California State Board of Education, Cortés drafted this 12-page statement of suggested principles for high school Ethnic Studies curricula to help break an impasse over the Model Curriculum. The original Model Curriculum had received 21,000 public comments, 18,000 of them negative, leading pro-ethnic studies legislators to refuse support until significant revisions occurred. Cortés's eight principles drew on his many years of involvement in college ethnic studies and were adapted by the State Department of Education into eight outcomes appearing on pages 16-20 of the final Model Curriculum, adopted by the California State Board of Education in March 2021. This document directly contributed to passage of California's Assembly Bill 101 (the Medina Bill), making California the first state to require all high school students to complete a one-semester course in Ethnic Studies.

Cortés, C. E. (2020). *City of Riverside anti-racism vision statement* [Policy document]. City of Riverside, Mayor's Multicultural Forum. (2 pages)
    Available: City of Riverside municipal archives
    Press coverage: Los Angeles Times, "Riverside seeks a racial reckoning"

Coordinating the work of the Mayor's Multicultural Forum after the 2020 Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, Cortés led development of this two-page anti-racism vision statement for the City of Riverside. The creation process involved drafts circulated to a mailing list of about 100 community members, with participants responding within five days with recommendations. Cortés insisted on terse, direct, brief language accessible to general audiences rather than academic jargon, with section headings followed by bullet points rather than dense paragraphs. The Riverside City Council adopted the statement by a 6-1 vote on October 20, 2020. The action received extensive newspaper coverage, including a front-section feature in the Los Angeles Times headlined "Riverside seeks a racial reckoning."

Mayor's Multicultural Forum. (2001). *Building a more inclusive Riverside community* [Community statement]. City of Riverside.
    Coordinated by Carlos E. Cortés
    Available: City of Riverside municipal archives

This inclusive community statement was adopted by the Mayor's Multicultural Forum in June 2001, two years after the Forum's establishment in 1999. Cortés served as facilitator for the development process, working with diverse community stakeholders to articulate shared values and commitments to inclusivity. The statement represents an early example of community-based diversity work that Cortés would later expand through the 2020 Anti-Racism Vision Statement. The 2001 statement established precedent for the Forum's role in developing city-wide diversity policies and demonstrated the effectiveness of transparent, community-inclusive processes that Cortés advocates in his 2025 "Renewing Multicultural Education" keynote.

University of California, Riverside, College of Humanities and Social Sciences. (1970s). *Diversity graduation requirement* [Curriculum policy].
    Drafted by Carlos E. Cortés
    Available: UC Riverside archives, College policy documents

In the 1970s, Cortés drafted the first diversity graduation requirement for UC Riverside's College of Humanities and Social Sciences. This modest requirement was adopted by a narrow faculty vote margin but proved historically significant as a precursor to diversity requirements that now exist at approximately one-third of U.S. colleges and universities. The requirement reflected growing recognition that students needed systematic exposure to diversity issues beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. This early curriculum innovation demonstrates Cortés's leadership in institutional change alongside his scholarly contributions, and it represents one of the earliest diversity graduation requirements in American higher education.

California State Education Department. (1971). *Report of the California Textbook Evaluation Task Force* [Government report].
    Carlos E. Cortés, Task Force Member
    Available: California State Library, government documents collections

In Fall 1971, Cortés served on California's first statewide task force evaluating ethnic content in social studies textbooks submitted for state adoption. This pioneering effort represented early governmental recognition that textbooks needed systematic review for accuracy, inclusivity, and bias regarding ethnic and racial content. The task force where James Banks and Cortés met assessed whether textbooks adequately represented diverse ethnic experiences or perpetuated stereotypes and omissions. This work influenced California's textbook adoption policies and contributed to nationwide movements for more inclusive curricula. The experience informed Cortés's subsequent textbook consultation work with Houghton Mifflin and McDougal Littell.

Cortés, C. E., & Osei, A. (2020-present). *Health equity, social justice, and anti-racism curriculum* [Required curricular thread]. UC Riverside School of Medicine.
    Co-directors: Carlos E. Cortés and Adwoa Osei, M.D.
    Available: UC Riverside School of Medicine internal curriculum materials

In 2020, the relatively new UC Riverside School of Medicine established this required curricular thread, and the academic dean invited Cortés to become part-time co-director, partnering with pediatrician Dr. Adwoa Osei. Initially hired for one year, Cortés entered his fifth year in the role as of 2025. The curriculum includes classes on health disparities for marginalized groups, cultural competence and cultural variations in patient care, working effectively with language translators, healthcare experiences of people with disabilities, and the neuroscience of diversity. Next-level topics include healthcare for transgender people. This curriculum represents a prototype of multicultural education applied to medical training and demonstrates the expansion of diversity education beyond traditional educational settings into professional schools.


========================================
SECTION 11: MEDIA CONSULTING PROJECTS
========================================

DreamWorks Animation. (2022). *Puss in boots: The last wish* [Animated feature film].
    Cultural Consultant: Carlos E. Cortés
    Studio: DreamWorks Animation
    Release: December 2022
    https://www.dreamworks.com/movies/puss-in-boots-the-last-wish

Cortés served as cultural consultant for this DreamWorks animated feature film, the sequel to 2011's "Puss in Boots" and a spin-off of the Shrek franchise. His role involved providing cultural expertise on the film's Latino characters and Spanish-language elements to ensure authentic and respectful representation. This consulting work extends Cortés's long involvement in media diversity, building on his research culminating in "The Children Are Watching" (2000) and his Creative/Cultural Advisory roles for Nickelodeon. The film was both a critical and commercial success, demonstrating that culturally authentic representation can enhance rather than limit mainstream appeal.

Nickelodeon Productions. (2000-2019). *Dora the Explorer* [Children's television series].
    Creative/Cultural Advisor: Carlos E. Cortés
    Network: Nickelodeon
    Awards: 2009 NAACP Image Award to Carlos E. Cortés for Creative/Cultural Advisory work
    https://www.nick.com/shows/dora-the-explorer

Cortés served as Creative/Cultural Advisor for this groundbreaking bilingual children's educational television series featuring a young Latina protagonist. His ongoing consultation helped ensure cultural authenticity, appropriate use of Spanish language, and positive representation of Latino culture for young audiences. "Dora the Explorer" became one of Nickelodeon's most successful and influential series, running from 2000 to 2019, and demonstrated the viability and appeal of bicultural programming for mainstream audiences. Cortés's work on the series earned him a 2009 NAACP Image Award for Creative/Cultural Advisory work, recognizing his contribution to improving diversity representation in children's media. The series thoroughly embodied principles of multicultural education, reaching millions of children during its 19-year run.

Nickelodeon Productions. (2005-2011). *Go, Diego, Go!* [Children's television series].
    Creative/Cultural Advisor: Carlos E. Cortés
    Network: Nickelodeon
    Awards: 2009 NAACP Image Award to Carlos E. Cortés for Creative/Cultural Advisory work
    https://www.nick.com/shows/go-diego-go

As a spin-off of "Dora the Explorer" featuring Dora's cousin Diego, this series focused on wildlife rescue and environmental education while maintaining bilingual and bicultural elements. Cortés provided Creative/Cultural Advisory services similar to his role on "Dora," ensuring continued authenticity in language use, cultural representation, and educational content. The series ran from 2005 to 2011 and extended the successful model of culturally inclusive children's programming. Cortés's consulting work on both Nickelodeon series demonstrated how multicultural education principles could be applied to mass media, reaching far more children than traditional classroom-based diversity education. His 2009 NAACP Image Award recognized his combined contributions to both series.


========================================
SECTION 12: UNPUBLISHED/IN PROGRESS WORKS
========================================

Cortés, C. E. (In progress). *Speech vs. diversity, diversity vs. speech: Fifty years at the intersection*.
    Publisher: To be determined
    Status: Nearly completed as of 2025

This book-length manuscript represents Cortés's synthesis of his research on the fifty-year trajectory of the relationship between diversity and speech, expanding on his 2019 fellowship research for the UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement. The work examines why a growing conflict emerged between diversity advocacy and free speech principles, despite their historical alliance during the civil rights movement when robust speech protections enabled challenges to discriminatory systems. Cortés's guiding question explores whether these values must be in tension or can reinforce each other. The book draws on his extensive experience in both multicultural education and academic freedom discourse communities, his observation that most free speech defenders are natural allies for diversity, and his concern that "speech-restricting linguistic arrogance" from some diversity advocates alienates these allies. As of his 2025 keynote, Cortés indicated the book was "nearly completed."


========================================
SECTION 13: TEACHING MATERIALS & WORKSHOPS
========================================

Cortés, C. E. (1970). *Chicano history* [Course]. University of California, Riverside.
    First offering: January 1970
    Historical significance: UCR's first Chicano History class; among early Chicano Studies courses in UC system
    Available: UC Riverside historical records

In January 1970, Cortés introduced and taught UC Riverside's first Chicano History class, among the earliest such courses in the University of California system. The course required one research paper; Chicanos could write about their own families, while non-Chicanos could interview a Chicano family or conduct other Chicano-focused research. When a young woman of Irish American ancestry asked to write about her own family, Cortés initially planned to refuse but instead created an alternative comparative assignment requiring analysis of similarities and differences between her family's journey and the Chicano historical experience. She wrote an excellent paper, and Cortés included this more-inclusive comparative option in subsequent syllabi. This early pedagogical decision reflects the inclusivity principle he would later advocate in his 2021 Ethnic Studies Principles and 2025 "Renewing Multicultural Education" keynote.

Cortés, C. E., & Wilkinson, L. (Past 25 years). *Teaching diversity* [Five-day professional development course]. Summer Institute for Intercultural Communication.
    Co-instructors: Carlos E. Cortés and Louise Wilkinson
    Duration: Five days
    Audience: Advanced professionals
    Status: Ongoing annually
    https://www.intercultural.org/

For the past 25+ years, Cortés and co-instructor Louise Wilkinson have taught this advanced five-day course at the Summer Institute for Intercultural Communication. The course compares inclusionist and intercultural approaches to diversity, examining theoretical frameworks, practical applications, and effectiveness of different diversity paradigms. Designed for advanced professionals including diversity trainers, educators, and organizational consultants, the course draws on Cortés's decades of experience and evolving thinking about diversity best practices. The longevity of the course (25+ years) indicates sustained demand for Cortés's expertise and his continued relevance in diversity training circles.

Cortés, C. E. (Ongoing). *Medical cultural competence workshops* [Professional development workshops].
    Facilitator: Carlos E. Cortés
    Venues: Various healthcare settings
    Topic: Cultural competence in healthcare
    Status: Ongoing

Cortés provides workshops on cultural competence for healthcare professionals, examining how cultural factors influence patient-provider interactions, health beliefs and behaviors, treatment adherence, and health outcomes. These workshops draw on his work co-directing UC Riverside School of Medicine's Health Equity, Social Justice, and Anti-Racism curriculum and his research on health disparities. The workshops address topics such as understanding cultural variations in patient communication, working effectively with interpreters, recognizing implicit bias in clinical settings, and providing equitable care across diverse populations. This work represents application of multicultural education principles to health professions beyond formal medical school curricula.

Cortés, C. E. (2018-present). *Inclusive diversity and abundant speech: An intersection of values at Aspirational University* [Educational simulation].
    Creator: Carlos E. Cortés
    First use: 2018
    Venues: UC San Diego (May 2018), University of Maryland College Park Civicus program (September 2018), Summer Institute for Intercultural Communication, others (used approximately dozen times)
    https://carlosecortes.com/

Developed in 2018 for civic engagement around the diversity-speech intersection, this simulation places participants in a fictional "Aspirational University" where they must establish campus regulations from scratch, balancing free expression values with inclusive diversity goals. Participants grapple with real dilemmas: speech codes, trigger warnings, speaker disinvitations, microaggression policies, and competing demands from various campus constituencies. The simulation format allows exploration of tensions without getting trapped in current political polarizations. Used approximately a dozen times at universities and professional development institutes, the simulation represents Cortés's pedagogical innovation in addressing contentious diversity issues. It embodies his "pivot to the future" philosophy by asking participants to create something new rather than merely critiquing existing approaches.

    "bio": "Dr. Carlos E. Cortés is a pioneering figure in multicultural education, ethnic studies, and diversity scholarship with a career spanning over five decades. Born in 1934 in Kansas City, Missouri, he grew up navigating the intersection of cultures as the son of Carlos Cortés, a Mexican Catholic immigrant from Guadalajara, and Florence Hoffman, the Jewish American daughter of Ukrainian and Austrian immigrants. This unique upbringing in a racially segregated, religiously divided community profoundly shaped his life's work on diversity and inclusion.",
    "personal_background": "In 1933, Carlos Cortés's father, a Mexican Catholic immigrant from Guadalajara, married Florence Hoffman, a Jewish American woman—an intermarriage before its time. Growing up in post-WWII Kansas City, young Carlos learned to navigate multiple identities. A defining moment came in 1949 when, as a sophomore, he was pressured by a Spanish teacher to go by 'Carl' instead of Carlos. His father stormed to the principal's office declaring: 'My son's name is Carlos. His father's name is Carlos. His grandfather's name was Carlos. His great-grandfather's name was Carlos. And I'll be damned if you're going to call him anything but Carlos.' This became a touchstone for authentic inclusivity throughout his career. He later wrote about these experiences in his memoir 'Rose Hill: An Intermarriage before Its Time' (2012) and adapted it into a one-person play performed nationwide.",

His 1971 service on California's first statewide textbook evaluation task force for ethnic content launched his national speaking career. His chapter 'Chicanos' in James Banks' influential 1973 book 'Teaching Ethnic Studies' was widely adopted for teacher training, establishing him as a founding voice in K-12 multicultural education. As he later reflected: 'We championed bridge-building inclusion without dividing the world into the oppressed and their oppressors. We committed ourselves to critical, uninhibited dialogue. When we sang \"We Shall Overcome,\" we meant it.'",

He became Consulting Humanist for The Cheech Marin Museum of Chicano Art & Culture, conducting filmed conversations exploring Chicano art and culture. In 2020, he became the first UCR faculty member to receive the Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award. His 'Renewing Diversity' blog series advocates for returning to the bridge-building, optimistic spirit of 1970s multicultural education. At 90, he continues to write, speak, and challenge the field: 'We can still overcome.'",
